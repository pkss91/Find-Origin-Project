Their legacy remains most prominent in Ireland and Great Britain, where traces of their language and culture are still prominent today.The existence of the Celts was first documented in the seventh or eighth century B.C. The Roman Empire, which ruled much of southern Europe at that time, referred to the Celts as “Galli,” meaning barbarians.However, the Celts were anything but barbarians, and many aspects of their culture and language have survived through the centuries.';
